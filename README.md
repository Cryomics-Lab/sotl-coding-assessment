# SoTL AI-Assisted Coding Assessment

## Overview
This assessment contains 16 coding problems. Complete as many as you can within the 2-hour time limit. You may work in **any programming language** — only your output files are graded.

Problems 1–12 are auto-graded (your output is compared to a known correct answer). Problems 13–16 are figure generation tasks that will be reviewed qualitatively.

## How It Works
1. Each problem is in its own folder under `problems/`
2. Read the `README.md` in each problem folder for the specification
3. Input data (if any) is in the `input/` subfolder
4. Write your solution and save output to the location specified in each problem
5. **Commit and push** to trigger auto-grading (Problems 1–12)
6. Check the "Actions" tab to see your score for auto-graded problems

## Starter Templates
Each problem has optional starter templates in `starters/` for Python and R. You are not required to use them.

## Rules
- You may use any programming language
- Auto-graded problems: only your output files are graded (not your code)
- Figure problems: save your figure as a PNG file as specified
- Internet access is allowed for documentation lookups
- Commit and push frequently — only your latest push is graded
