# SoTL AI-Assisted Coding Assessment

## Overview
This assessment contains 8 coding problems of increasing difficulty. Complete as many as you can within the 2-hour time limit. You may work in **any programming language** — only your output files are graded.

## How It Works
1. Each problem is in its own folder under `problems/`
2. Read the `README.md` in each problem folder for the specification
3. Input data (if any) is in the `input/` subfolder
4. Write your solution and save output to the location specified in each problem
5. **Commit and push** to trigger auto-grading
6. Check the "Actions" tab to see your score
