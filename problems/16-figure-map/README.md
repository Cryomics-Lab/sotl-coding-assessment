# Problem 16: Map — Manitoba Stations and Points

## Specification
Create a **publication-quality map** of Manitoba showing:
1. Station locations (from `problems/05-merge-and-summarize/input/stations.csv`) as labeled points
2. Geographic points (from `problems/08-optimize-search/input/points.csv`) as colored points, colored by `category`

## Requirements
- **Map extent**: Covers all stations and points in Manitoba
- **Coordinate system**: Appropriate projection for Manitoba (e.g., UTM Zone 14, or just lat/lon if clearly labeled)
- **North arrow**: Compass rose or simple north indicator
- **Scale bar**: Distance scale in km or miles
- **Coordinate grid**: Latitude/longitude grid or UTM grid
- **Station labels**: Station names labeled on the map
- **Point coloring**: Points colored by category with legend
- **Clean aesthetics**: Professional appearance suitable for publication

## Output
Save your figure as: `problems/16-figure-map/map.png`

You may use a base map (e.g., OpenStreetMap, satellite, or just a simple background) or a blank canvas. The key is showing geographic relationships and all required elements.
