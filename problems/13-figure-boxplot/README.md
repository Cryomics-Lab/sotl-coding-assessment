# Problem 13: Boxplot — Temperature by Station

## Specification
Using the weather data from Problem 2 (`problems/02-csv-column-mean/input/weather.csv`), create a **publication-quality boxplot** showing the distribution of daily temperatures (`temp_c`) by station (`station_id`).

## Requirements
- **Axis labels**: X-axis labeled "Station", Y-axis labeled "Temperature (°C)"
- **Title**: "Daily Temperature Distribution by Station"
- **No chart junk**: No unnecessary gridlines, borders, or decorative elements
- **Colorblind-friendly palette**: Use a palette accessible to people with color blindness
- **Figure size**: Appropriate for a journal column width (~89 mm or 350 pixels at 96 dpi)
- **Legend**: Include if stations are colored
- **Clean aesthetics**: Professional appearance suitable for publication

## Output
Save your figure as: `problems/13-figure-boxplot/boxplot.png`

Include all 5 stations from the weather data. Do not include a legend if color is the only distinguishing feature (station labels on X-axis are sufficient).
