# Example Criteria for Boxplot Submission

A high-quality boxplot submission should have:

1. **Data Representation**
   - Shows box (interquartile range), median line, whiskers, and outliers
   - Covers all 5 stations with distinct visual separation
   - No data points are missing or incorrectly aggregated

2. **Visual Design**
   - Clean, uncluttered appearance
   - Appropriate font sizes (readable but not oversized)
   - Consistent use of white or neutral background
   - Professional color scheme (e.g., ColorBrewer Set 2, Okabe-Ito palette)

3. **Labels and Titles**
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Y-axis labeled with units ("Temperature (°C)")
   - X-axis labeled or directly showing station names
   - No abbreviations unless necessary

4. **Technical Quality**
   - High resolution (≥300 dpi for print, or 96 dpi at minimum 350 pixels wide)
   - Saved as PNG with good compression
   - No compression artifacts or blurriness

Example layouts:
- 1 panel with 5 boxplots side-by-side
- 1 panel with all stations, color-coded, labels on axes
- Margins/padding appropriate for integration into a document
