# Example Criteria for Scatterplot Submission

A high-quality scatterplot submission should have:

1. **Data Representation**
   - Points plotted for all valid observations (exclude rows with missing temp_c or snow_depth_cm)
   - Points distinctly colored by station
   - Trend line visible and appropriate for the data

2. **Handling Overplotting**
   - If many points overlap, use transparency (alpha) or smaller point sizes
   - Alternatively, use jitter or 2D density contours
   - Ensure all data is visible despite overlapping

3. **Visual Design**
   - Clear color scheme distinguishing stations
   - Appropriate point size (not too large, not invisible)
   - Legend clearly labeled with station names

4. **Trend Line**
   - Linear regression line or LOWESS smoother (must be explicitly noted)
   - Confidence interval or standard error band (optional but recommended)
   - Extends across the full range of data

5. **Labels and Title**
   - Clear axis labels with units
   - Descriptive title
   - Legend positioned appropriately (not obscuring data)

6. **Technical Quality**
   - High resolution (≥300 dpi for print, or 96 dpi at minimum 350 pixels wide)
   - Saved as PNG with good compression
