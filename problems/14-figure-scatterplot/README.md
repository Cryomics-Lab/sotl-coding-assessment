# Problem 14: Scatterplot — Temperature vs. Snow Depth

## Specification
Using the observations data from Problem 5 (`problems/05-merge-and-summarize/input/observations.csv`), create a **publication-quality scatterplot** showing the relationship between daily temperature (`temp_c`) and snow depth (`snow_depth_cm`), with points colored by station (`station_id`).

## Requirements
- **Axes**: X-axis "Temperature (°C)", Y-axis "Snow Depth (cm)"
- **Title**: "Temperature vs. Snow Depth by Station"
- **Legend**: Show which color corresponds to which station
- **Trend line**: Include an overall trend line (e.g., linear regression line) with 95% confidence interval
- **Point size & alpha**: Adjust transparency and size to handle overplotting (if many points overlap)
- **Clean aesthetics**: Professional appearance suitable for publication

## Output
Save your figure as: `problems/14-figure-scatterplot/scatterplot.png`
