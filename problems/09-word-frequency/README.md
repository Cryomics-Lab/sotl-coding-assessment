# Problem 9: Word Frequency Count

## Specification
Read the text file at `input/ecology_text.txt` and count the frequency of each word (case-insensitive).

Output the top 20 most frequent words, sorted by:
1. Frequency (descending)
2. Alphabetically for ties

Exclude common English stop words (a, an, the, and, or, of, to, in, for, is, it, as, be, by, but, etc.). You may use a standard stop word list or create your own.

## Output
Save to: `problems/09-word-frequency/output.csv`

```
rank,word,frequency
1,word1,XXX
2,word2,XXX
...
20,word20,X
```

Exactly 20 rows plus header. Frequency column is an integer count.
