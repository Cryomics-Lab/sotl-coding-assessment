# Example Criteria for Bar Chart Submission

A high-quality bar chart submission should have:

1. **Data Representation**
   - Bars for each combination of status code and log level
   - Bars grouped logically (status codes on X, levels grouped within each status)
   - All status codes present in the data are represented

2. **Sorting**
   - X-axis sorted numerically by status code (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 401, 500)
   - Status codes clearly labeled on X-axis

3. **Visual Design**
   - Distinct colors for each log level (ERROR, INFO, WARN)
   - Clear visual separation between bars
   - Appropriate spacing and sizing

4. **Error Indication**
   - Visual distinction or callout for error status codes (400+)
   - Examples: different fill pattern, highlight color, or annotation
   - Helps readers quickly identify problematic responses

5. **Labels and Legend**
   - Clear axis labels with appropriate names
   - Descriptive title
   - Legend clearly showing which color = which log level
   - Y-axis shows count values

6. **Technical Quality**
   - High resolution (≥300 dpi for print, or 96 dpi at minimum 350 pixels wide)
   - Saved as PNG with good compression
